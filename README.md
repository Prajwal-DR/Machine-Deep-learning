# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of machine learning projects! This repository contains explorations, experiments, and implementations of neural networks and deep learning techniques using PyTorch and from-scratch frameworks. Each subfolder represents a specific theme or framework.

---

## ðŸ”¸ `makemore/`
This folder contains implementations based on the [makemore](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore) project by Andrej Karpathy, focusing on character-level language models.

### Contents:
- `MLP_nn.ipynb` â€” A Multi-Layer Perceptron implementation for a simple task.
- `bigram_nn.ipynb` â€” A character-level bigram language model.
- `names.txt` â€” A dataset of names used for training the language model.

---

## ðŸ”¸ `micro_gpt/`
A work-in-progress folder focusing on digit classification and a scaled-down GPT-like architecture.

### Contents:
- `DigitClassifier_pytorch.ipynb` â€” A PyTorch model for classifying handwritten digits (MNIST).
- `ImageClassifier.ipynb` â€” General image classification pipeline using PyTorch.
- `microgpt_inprogress.ipynb` â€” A minimal GPT model under development.
- `mnist_scaled.npz` â€” A NumPy-compressed version of the MNIST dataset, scaled for efficient training/testing.
- `playgrnd.ipynb` â€” A sandbox notebook for testing and prototyping models and ideas.

## ðŸ”¸ `micrograd_pg/`
This section implements and extends Karpathy's [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) â€” a tiny autograd engine.

### Contents:
- `Micrograd.py` â€” A basic implementation of reverse-mode autodiff.
- `micrograd.ipynb` â€” Interactive walkthrough of the autodiff engine.
- `micrograd_engine.ipynb` â€” Enhanced or modular version of the micrograd engine.
- `__pycache__/` â€” Compiled Python bytecode (auto-generated).
